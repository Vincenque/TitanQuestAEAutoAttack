## How to edit script
If you want to edit script you need to:
1. Clone or download ZIP of this repository and unpack it.
2. Download and install newest version of python from https://www.python.org/downloads/. I have version 3.11.1.
3. Open cmd and paste those lines. It will install libraries.
```
py -m ensurepip 
py -m pip install --upgrade pip 
py -m pip install pyautogui 
```
4. Open 'TitanQuestAEAutoAttack.py' with 'Idle (Python 3.11 64-bit)'.
