## How to edit script
If you want to edit script you need to:
1. Clone or download ZIP of this repository and unpack it.
2. Download and install newest version of python from https://www.python.org/downloads/. I have version 3.11.1.
3. Open cmd and paste those lines. It will install libraries.
```
py -m ensurepip 
py -m pip install --upgrade pip 
py -m pip install pyautogui 
py -m pip install customtkinter
```
4. Open 'TitanQuestAEAutoAttack.py' with 'Idle (Python 3.11 64-bit)'.

## Settings
This script should work only with full HD resolution (1920x1080).
Hud size in game needs to be set to 'Normal'.
Also you need to have game on your primary screen.

## How to use script
To turn on just press 'O'.
Same to turn off.
When script is running you just need to point on enemy.
Then your character should start attacking it.
If you are playing as a ranged character I recommend holding 'shift', because your character, instead of atttacking, may go to place which you are pointing.
